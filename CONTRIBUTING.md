We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

### We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

### Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). Make sure to search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.

#### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. Some guidelines when creating an issue:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can (a screenshot or a codepen will go a long way explaining your issue)
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

#### Pull Requests

- Only fix/add the functionality in question OR address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Use a consistent commit message, preferably in this format
  - `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`. ### Samples:
    ```sh
     docs: add CONTRIBUTING guide
     refactor: number methods
    ```
    See [angular commit guide](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format) for more details.
- Add unit tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).

_PS: if for some reasons the format command doesn't run while making a commit, please make sure to format your code with `npm run format` or `yarn run format`_

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow

- Fork the repository to your own Github account
- Clone the project to your machine
- Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
- Commit changes to the branch
- Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
- Push changes to your fork
- Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
